For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
		With the current climate due to the pandemic, cooking at home has become more of a neccessity, and going out and
	shopping is something that is done a lot more sparingly. People don't want to linger in public places any longer 
	than they have to. 
		My application would allow the user to store their favorite/commonly used recipes and use those recipes to generate 
	concise grocery shopping lists with recipes that enable them to get exactly what they need to make those meals. The 
	application would allow the user to keep a log of what items they already have in their pantry (along with their 
	expiration date) and take that into account when generating those grocery lists as to not purchase items they 
	already have. This would allow users to be more conscious of what they have, and what exactly they need, making the
	process of cooking at home less of a hassle.
